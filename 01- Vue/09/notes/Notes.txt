How are computed properties used in Vue.js?

Filtering data
Calculations
Boolean conditionals within the v-if 
Using computed properties with mapGetters
Using computed properties as setters (unorthodox)

Computed properties cache results, meaning a computed property only executes once after the component
is mounted except for any of its dependency changes. A method, meanwhile, executes every time
that method is called in the component.

... they allow you to read and write cleaner, scalable, and more readable code.
