Virtual DOM (VDOM) <--------- Is a lightweight JS representation of the DOM
------------------

The VDOM is a programming concept where an ideal, or "virtual", 
representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.

... Updating the virtual DOM is comparatively faster than updating the actual DOM.
